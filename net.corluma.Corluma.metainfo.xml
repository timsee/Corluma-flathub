      Corluma provides users with multiple color pickers and palettes to quickly choose the exact right color for your lights. For lights that support it, Corluma can also create and access lighting routines that change colors over time. Do you have too many lights? Simplify managing them by grouping them and controlling them all at once. Did you spend a lot of time getting your lights to look just right? You can save light settings and set them back to their exact state at a later date with just a few clicks.
